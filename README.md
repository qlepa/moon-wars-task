# General requirements
Using SWAPI: https://swapi.co/documentation

Build an application to select random people or starships and render their details to see
who would win based on a common attribute.
i.e. people have mass and starships have crew. A person with greater mass wins, a
starship with more crew wins.
The app should render the attributes from the resource in a simple web page that allows
you to 'play' the game.
Once two cards are displayed the app should declare one of the cards a winner based on
the higher common attribute.
Having displayed the winning card, the user should be able to play again using an action
button that repeats the same request.
